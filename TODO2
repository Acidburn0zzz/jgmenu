SHORT TERM THINGS TO DO
=======================

Sort out positioning (incl issue #20)
  - Add item_padding_x
  - Add margin_x to menu_width()
  - Add align CENTER
  - Add menu_padding_{l,r,t,b}
	(no need to call it root - if submenus have different padding we can call them sub_padding)
  - Add icon_margin_r (i.e. distance between icon and text)
	item_margin_x won't always be suitable.

Update examples/
    - Create README
    - Make ex??.sh self-sufficient

Add info() for fprintf(stderr, "info: ....\n");

Add locale and UTF-8 support to XKeyEvent loop (Issue #26)

Support system wide configuration (Issue #27)

Add ^term() find terminal and wrap around commands

Add atexit()-cleanup() so that it's easier to spot potential run-time memory
leaks with ASAN and Valgrind

=== Upversion to 0.6 ===


VARIOUS THINGS TO DO IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
===========================================

Refactor jgmenu.c to prepare for config file re-load
	- create arg.c for command line args
	- make sure we free strings in config.c

Check tint2rc 'modified time' and re-read on change
Consider the same for jgmenurc and tint2-sessionfile (bl)

Add tint2_config_file (in case it's different to ~/.config/tint2/tint2rc)

argv_buf delim

Add explaination on JGMENU_EXEC_PATH

Remove XINERAMA ifdefs

Rename filter list (as it clashes with filter_)

Write jgmenu-config in C to expand ~ + $ to avoid "sh -c" in jgmenu-start.sh
and jgmenu_run (it doesn't look nice in `top`)

Add option to read fd other than STDIN (--menu-file=)

Add shareness with symlinks

widgets.c
---------
	enum fixed_type {ICON, RECT, TEXT, SEARCH};
	@type-action-x-y-w-h-r-halign-valign-fgcol-bgcol-content
		NOTES:
		  - x, y: distance from edge
		  - 'content' is icon_path or text
		  - For RECT, a 1px thick border will be drawn using fgcol
Add scroll_bar

Add man-page for jgmenu_run ob

Write jgmenu-init.sh --help message.

Add jgmenuconf
	Would need jgmenu_run init and jgmenu_run config

Remove harded coded variables (such as 22, etc)

Check if variable is number in shell script (=isnumeric())
(needed in jgmenu-cache.sh)

Add equivalent to ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini | grep... in theme.c

Add rtrim, ltrim, trim, to sbuf.c

ISSUES
======
The window is 1px out on Ubuntu (up and left). Investigate.

When starting (not awaking) jgmenu, tint2 sets the pointer to "hour glass".
Consider how this could be avoided.
