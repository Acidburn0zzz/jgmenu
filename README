Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
jgmenu is written with the following aims:
  - Be a stand-alone, simple and contemporary-looking menu
  - Be hackable with a clean, small code base
  - Minimise features and bloat
  - Work with linux, openbox and tint2
  - Have co-ordinate and alignment parameters to avoid xdotool hacks, etc.
  - Contain similar settings to tint2 (e.g. padding, transparency)
  - Have few dependencies (perferably just Xlib, cairo and Xinerama)
  - Be free from toolkits such as GTK and Qt.
  - Read the menu items from stdin in a similar way to dmenu and dzen2, but
    with seperate fields for the name and command 
    (a bit like dzen2 -m with ^ca parameter).
    E.g. echo -e "terminal,xterm\nfile manager,pcmanfm" | jgmenu

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
	make
	make install
	jgmenu_run

Usage
~~~~~
The program reads the menu items from stdin.  Menu items are seperated by a
new-line character ('\n').  Empty lines and lines beginning with '#' are 
ignored.

The menu item "description" and "command" are seperated by a comma.

Submenus can be defined and checked out using ^tag() and ^checkout()
markup in the "command" field.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
Example 1:
	echo -e "terminal,xterm\nfilemanager,pcmanfm" | jgmenu

Example 2:
	cat << EOF >> menu.txt
	terminal,xterm
	file manager,pcmanfm
	settings,^checkout(settings)
	Settings,^tag(settings)
	background,nitrogen
	EOF

	jgmenu < menu.txt
	cat menu.txt | jgmenu

Example 3:
	cat << EOF >> menu.sh
	#!/bin/bash
	(
	echo -e "terminal\nxterm"
	echo -e "file manager\npcmanfm"
	) | jgmenu
	EOF
	
	chmod +x menu.sh
	./menu.sh
