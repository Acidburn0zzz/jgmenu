The jgmenu tutorial
.SH INTRODUCTION
.PP
This tutorial aims to explain the usage of jgmenu through a set of
.PD 0
.P
.PD
lessons.
.SH LESSONS
.SS Lesson 1
.PP
After installing jgmenu, you can get going quickly by running:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
jgmenu
\f[]
.fi
.PP
That's it!
.PP
There are three points worth noting about what you have just done:
.IP \[bu] 2
You should see a \[lq]Linux/BSD system\[rq] menu showing installed
.PD 0
.P
.PD
applications.
We call this menu \[lq]pmenu\[rq] (explained in lesson 7).
.IP \[bu] 2
If you use tint2, jgmenu should have based its appearance and
.PD 0
.P
.PD
alignment on tint2rc.
.IP \[bu] 2
You have just started a long\-running application.
If you click
.PD 0
.P
.PD
outside the menu, press escape or select a menu item (using
.PD 0
.P
.PD
mouse or keyboard), the menu will no longer be visible but is
.PD 0
.P
.PD
still running.
It can be awoken (made visible) by executing
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\f[C]jgmenu_run\f[].
.PP
If you wish to override any default settings, you can create a
.PD 0
.P
.PD
config file by running:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
jgmenu\ init
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Edit this config file (~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc) to suit your
.PD 0
.P
.PD
system.
Read the man page jgmenu(1) for further information.
.PP
If you have a config file at ~/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc and want to
.PD 0
.P
.PD
ignore it for the purposes of running one of the lessons, just use
.PD 0
.P
.PD
the command line argument \[lq]\[en]config\-file=\[rq] without
specifying a file.
.SS Lesson 2
.PP
You can also start jgmenu with
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
jgmenu_run
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The advantage of this wrapper is that it will either awake jgmenu or
.PD 0
.P
.PD
start a new instance depending on if it is already running or not.
.PP
This makes it suitable for using with panels and keyboard shortcuts.
.PP
See https://github.com/johanmalm/jgmenu/wiki for futher info on
.PD 0
.P
.PD
panel and window manager integration.
.SS Lesson 3
.PP
From this point onwards, it is assumed that you understand basic
.PD 0
.P
.PD
shell usage including re\-direction (e.g.
<, >) and piping (e.g.
|).
.PP
The syntax below (here\-document) is used to denote the creation of a
.PD 0
.P
.PD
text file from whatever is between the EOFs.
You can of course use
.PD 0
.P
.PD
your favourite text editor instead.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cat\ >file\ <<EOF
foo
bar
EOF
\f[]
.fi
.PP
There are many ways to run jgmenu.
In lesson 1, you saw jgmenu as a
.PD 0
.P
.PD
long\-running application.
As we go through the next few lessons we
.PD 0
.P
.PD
will run jgmenu as a short\-lived applications.
This means that it
.PD 0
.P
.PD
starts from scratch every time it is called.
.PP
So let's get back to basics.
Try the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
echo\ >foo.txt\ <<EOF
xterm
firefox
EOF
\f[]
.fi
.PP
If you have not got used to the here\-document syntax yet, it just
.PD 0
.P
.PD
means that you put the words \[lq]xterm\[rq] and \[lq]firefox\[rq] in a
text file
.PD 0
.P
.PD
(which you can of course do using a text editor).
Then do:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cat\ foo.txt\ |\ jgmenu\ \-\-simple\ \-\-icon\-size=0
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The option \[en]simple make jgmenu short\-lived, disables all syncing
.PD 0
.P
.PD
with tint2 and reads menu items from \f[I]stdin\f[].
.PP
The option \[en]icon\-size=0, disables icons (i.e.\ it does not just
.PD 0
.P
.PD
display them at zero size, it actually avoids loading them)
.SS Lesson 4
.PP
As you saw in the previous example, each line fed to \f[I]stdin\f[]
becomes
.PD 0
.P
.PD
a menu item.
Any line containing two fields separated by a comma
.PD 0
.P
.PD
is parsed as \f[I]description\f[],\f[I]command\f[].
Consider the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cat\ <<EOF\ >menu.sh
#!/bin/sh
(
printf\ "Terminal,xterm\\n"
printf\ "File\ Manager,pcmanfm\\n"
)\ |\ jgmenu\ \-\-vsimple
EOF

chmod\ +x\ menu.sh
\&./menu.sh
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This lets you give a more meaningful description to each menu item.
.PP
The command line argument \[en]vsimple is the same as \[en]simple, but
also
.PD 0
.P
.PD
disables icons and ignores jgmenurc (if it exists).
.SS Lesson 5
.PP
To display icons, you need to populate the third field.
.PP
By default, jgmenu will obtain the icon theme from xsettings (if
.PD 0
.P
.PD
it is running) or tint2rc (if it exists).
When running with the
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\[en]simple argument, make sure that \f[I]icon_theme\f[] is set to
something
.PD 0
.P
.PD
sensible in your $HOME/.config/jgmenu/jgmenurc.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
(
Browser,firefox,firefox
File\ manager,pcmanfm,system\-file\-manager
Terminal,xterm,utilities\-terminal
Lock,i3lock\ \-c\ 000000,system\-lock\-screen
Exit\ to\ prompt,openbox\ \-\-exit,system\-log\-out
Reboot,systemctl\ \-i\ reboot,system\-reboot
Poweroff,systemctl\ \-i\ poweroff,system\-shutdown
)\ |\ jgmenu\ \-\-simple
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In the third field you can also specify the full path if you wish
.PD 0
.P
.PD
e.g.
\[lq]/usr/share/icons/Faenza/places/22/folder.png\[rq]
.SS Lesson 6
.PP
So far we have looked at producing a single \[lq]root\[rq] menu only.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
jgmenu understands a small amount of markup and enables submenus
.PD 0
.P
.PD
by ^tag() and ^checkout().
Try this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cat\ <<EOF\ >menu.txt
Terminal,xterm
File\ Manager,pcmanfm
Settings,^checkout(settings)

^tag(settings)
Set\ Background\ Image,nitrogen
EOF

jgmenu\ \-\-vsimple\ \-\-csv\-file="menu.txt"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
In pseudo\-code, build your CSV file as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#\ the\ root\-menu
sub1,^checkout(sub1)
sub2,^checkout(sub2)

#\ the\ first\ sub\-menu
^tag(sub1)
item1.1
item1.2

#\ the\ second\ sub\-menu
^tag(sub2)
item2.1
item2.2
\f[]
.fi
.SS Lesson 7
.PP
freedesktop.org have developed a menu standard which is adhered to
.PD 0
.P
.PD
by the big Desktop Environments.
We will refer to this type of menu
.PD 0
.P
.PD
as XDG.
jgmenu can run three types of XDG(ish) menus: pmenu, xdg and
.PD 0
.P
.PD
lx.
.PP
To understand the subtleties between them, you need a basic
.PD 0
.P
.PD
appreciataion of the XDG menu\-spec and desktop\-entry\-spec.
See:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
http://standards.freedesktop.org/ for further information.
.PP
To keep things simple, when discussing XDG paths, only one location
.PD 0
.P
.PD
will be referred to rather than XDG variables and every possible
.PD 0
.P
.PD
location.
So for example, if \[lq]/usr/share\[rq] is quoted, it may refer to
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\[lq]/usr/local/share\[rq], \[lq]$HOME/.local/share\[rq], etc on your
system.
.PP
In brief, there are three types of files which define the Linux/BSD
.PD 0
.P
.PD
system menu:
.IP \[bu] 2
\&.menu (/etc/xdg/menus)
.PD 0
.P
.PD
These are XML files describing such things as the menu categories
.PD 0
.P
.PD
and directory structure.
.IP \[bu] 2
\&.directory (/usr/share/desktop\-directories)
.PD 0
.P
.PD
These describe the menu directories
.IP \[bu] 2
\&.desktop (/usr/share/applications)
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Each application has a .desktop file associated with it.
These
.PD 0
.P
.PD
files contain most of the information needed to build a menu
.PD 0
.P
.PD
(e.g.
\[lq]Name\[rq], \[lq]Exec command\[rq], \[lq]Icon\[rq],
\[lq]Category\[rq])
.PP
\f[C]pmenu\f[] is written in python by \@o9000.
It uses .directory and
.PD 0
.P
.PD
\&.desktop files to build a menu, but ignores any .menu files.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
Instead of the structure specified in the .menu file, it simply maps
.PD 0
.P
.PD
each \[lq].desktop\[rq] application onto one of the \[lq].directory\[rq]
categories.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
If a matching \[lq].directory\[rq] category does not exist, it tries to
.PD 0
.P
.PD
cross\-reference \[lq]additional categories\[rq] to \[lq]related
categories\[rq] in
.PD 0
.P
.PD
accordance with the XDG menu\-spec.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
This is a generic approach which avoids Desktop Environment specific
.PD 0
.P
.PD
rules defined in the .menu file.
It ensures that all .desktop files
.PD 0
.P
.PD
are included in the menu.
.PP
\f[C]xdg\f[] is written in C by myself.
It uses libxml2 to parse the .menu
.PD 0
.P
.PD
file, but is otherwise written from scratch.
It adheres to the
.PD 0
.P
.PD
basics of XDG's menu\-spec but is not fully compliant.
.PP
\f[C]lx\f[] uses LXDE's libmenu\-cache to generate an XDG compliant menu
.PD 0
.P
.PD
including separators and internationalization.
.PP
Set \f[C]csv_cmd\f[] in jgmenurc to specify which of these csv\-commands
you
.PD 0
.P
.PD
wish to run.
.SS Lesson 8
.PP
You can create a very simple XDG menu without any directories or
.PD 0
.P
.PD
categories in the following way:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
jgmenu_run\ xdg\ \-\-no\-dirs\ |\ jgmenu\ \-\-vsimple
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\[lq]xdg \[en]no\-dirs\[rq] outputs all apps with a .desktop file
.PD 0
.P
.PD
(normally in /usr/share/applications) without and categories
.PD 0
.P
.PD
or directories.
.PP
jgmenu has a \f[I]search\f[] capability.
When a menu is open, just start
.PD 0
.P
.PD
typing to invoke a filter.
.SS Lesson 9
.PP
When running pmenu, xdg or lx, you can add menu items to the root
.PD 0
.P
.PD
menu by editing append.csv and/or prepend.csv in ~/.config/jgmenu.
.PP
For example, you could do:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cat\ >$HOME/.config/jgmenu/prepend.csv\ <<EOF
Browser,firefox,firefox
File\ manager,pcmanfm,system\-file\-manager
Terminal,xterm,utilities\-terminal
^sep()
EOF

cat\ >$HOME/.config/jgmenu/append.csv\ <<EOF
^sep()
Exit\ to\ prompt,openbox\ \-\-exit,system\-log\-out
Suspend,systemctl\ \-i\ suspend,system\-log\-out
Reboot,systemctl\ \-i\ reboot,system\-reboot
Poweroff,systemctl\ \-i\ poweroff,system\-shutdown
EOF
\f[]
.fi
.PP
^sep() inserts a horizontal separator line
