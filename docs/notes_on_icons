NOTES ON ICONS
==============

Some of the content of this file has not been implemented yet. It's just ideas
which I will try to incorporate.

1.  The main loop kicks off two threads to load icons:
    (A) The root menu; (B) The rest
    B starts when A is finished. This allows the root-menu to be displayed
    quickly whilst the rest is loaded in the background.

2.  icon.c stats icons in
    ~/.local/share/icons/jgmenu-cache/<size>/
    This directory contains symlinks pointing to icons which match the
    name, size and theme.

    For example:

	folder -> /usr/share/icons/Adwaita/22x22/places/folder.png

    Symlinking without file extensions saves time when stating as we don't
    have to try with .png, .svg, xpm for each one.

    If the user changes icon_size or icon_theme in jgmenurc, we prevent the
    old cache from being loaded in the following way:

      - The _size_ is part of the path we stat (e.g. jgmenu-cache/<size>),
        so if it does not exist we know it.

      - The _theme_ is stored in index.theme under "Inherits=".
        We throw an error if it is wrong.

3.  Any icon-names which fail the stat are saved in a list and dealt
    with as follows:

      - icon-find.c finds their full path if they exist (time-consuming)

      - icon.c spawns "jgmenu_run cache --amend <name> <path>" for any icons
	missing in the cache.
        If an icon cannot be found on the system, an empty file is created
	in the cache instead of the symlink in order to prevent un-neccesary
        searching in future.

4.  icon-find.c puts all "wanted" icon names in a hashmap before searching.
    As the expensive search happens each file will be compared with the hashmap
    keys. The search includes
      - A ftw of the theme directory
      - A dirent of /usr/share/pixmaps
      - A dirent of /usr/share/icons
      - etc
