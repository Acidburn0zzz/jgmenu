BUG

bg colour is transparent if tint2rc is missing and tint2_look==1


WIP
---

Add --no-dirs to pmenu

Add TOC to jgmenututorial(7)

sub_padding: change -1 to 'auto'. If auto, take smallest menu_padding

Add notes on _NET_WORKAREA to man page

ob: - consider where tempfile lives...
    - use new --cmd= syntax when CSV produced

Consider add % at start of command in order to not hide_or_exit() (issue #55)

jgmenu(1): explain what the different colours refer to

charset.c: do not assert s == e

lx: check .desktop files are not Unicode in order to avoid segfault
(Add unit test to prove problem - to include extace.desktop)

Rename screen{_x0,_y0...} variables to simply screen (as a struct area)

Do we remove geo_set_screen_area() again?

Investigate duplicate .desktop entries on Raspberry Pi and nixOS

Cleanliness
-----------

	jgmenu - warn if strange command line argument is given

	Refactor icon.c
		- merge struct icon and icon_path
		- is xdgdirs inited twice?
		- split icon.c into image.c and icon.c
		- rename functions (e.g. icon_set_name() --> icon_add())

	checkout_parent(): consider the case when current window has child(ren)

	free string-lists with builtin sbuf_ function

	Remove parse_caret_action (it was only really good for deleting the
	closing bracket which we do up-front now anyway)

	Simplify geometry.c by enabling access to config.h variables

	In x11-ui.c, create
		- linked list of windows
		- 'static Window active_window' (instead of ui->w[ui->cur].win)

	Pipemenu
		- check duplicate tag names
		- load icons for pipes

	parse-ob.c: remove return_cmd
			Read JGMENU_PREPEND_FILE env var (and read ~/.config/jgmenu/prepend.csv by default)

	Move struct item/node code to data.c.
		  - Refactor all the checkout_* functions. They're confusing.

	The first item in master list is always a tag-item, so remove old code
	which handles exceptions

	Refactor around read_csv_file and creating items

	Remove spawn from config (make it args_ instead).

	Replace strdups+free with x-alternatives
		replace various warn() with BUG_ON

	Set by argv_buf delim by default to make it 'safer'

	Add explaination on JGMENU_EXEC_PATH

	Rename filter list (as it clashes with filter_) (maybe 'disp'?)

	Remove harded coded variables (such as 22, etc)

Improvements / New features
---------------------------

	Add widgets including icon, rect and text

	Review fields
		1: name
		2: command (begin with @ to aviod sh -c '' wrapper and
                   therefore adhere to XDG spec)
		3: icon
		4: comment (for pop up or item spanning two lines)
		5: working directory (start in $HOME be default)
		6: meta data (e.g. categories to enable filter buttons)

	Consider adding a ^filter()

	init: Parse polybar config files

	Add jgmenu-xdg.c localisation

	xdg: read xfce menu

	Add watch.c to check changes to .desktop files, tint2, xsettings, jgmenurc,
	etc. on wake-up
		- Check tint2rc 'modified time' and re-read on change
		- Consider the same for jgmenurc and tint2-sessionfile (bl)

	Pango markup

	Add menu_height config option

	Add CENTER to menu_halign and menu_valign

	Add scroll_bar

	Support for adding favourites in real-time (e.g. keyboard shortcut for
	locking menu-item onto the root menu - or similar)

	Consider "hover" features and "inline expansion" of menus
