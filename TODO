HIGH-LEVEL ROADMAP
==================

  - Improve performance of icon cache

  - Create multi-window mode where submenus open in separate windows

  - Write XDG menu parser based on libmenu-cache (probably "jgmenu_run lx")

  - Pipemenus

  - Support for adding favourites in real-time (e.g. keyboard shortcut for
    locking menu-item onto the root menu - or similar)

  - Add support for "fixed-position" items such as icons/images and shapes

  - Add search box

AFTER v1.0
----------
  - Consider "hover" features and "inline expansion" of menus

  - On wake-up, check changes to .desktop files, tint2, xsettings,
    jgmenurc, etc.
